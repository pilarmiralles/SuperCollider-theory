# SuperCollider theory and practice
This compilation of theory and practice in the SuperCollider programming language has been developed from all the knowledge I inherited from my dearest SuperCollider teachers, Sergio Luque and Alejandro Olarte.
Everything is still in development and being infused, progressively, with my own aesthetics. Nevertheless, the credit for many of the examples goes to them.
